                <p>The Eurovision Song Contest is a pop song contest among the member countries of the European Broadcasting Union. The owner of all
                     intellectual property produced within the framework of the competition is also the European Broadcasting Union.
                    One representative from each of the EMU member countries that have submitted applications for participation participates in the competition. 
                    The contest is held live. From each country, one representative (soloist or musical group) can participate, performing a song lasting no more than 
                    three minutes. No more than six people should perform on stage during the performance. After the performance of all participants, the most popular 
                    song is determined by a vote of the viewers and the jury. All countries participating in the final and semi-final participate in the voting.
                    The competition has been held every year since 1956 and is one of the most popular non-sporting events in the world, with an audience of up to 600 million
                     viewers.
